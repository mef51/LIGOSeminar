* mind-bending analogy: "Gravitational waves are constantly passing Earth; however, even the strongest have a minuscule effect and their sources are generally at a great distance. For example, the waves given off by the cataclysmic final merger of GW150914 reached Earth after travelling over a billion lightyears, as a ripple in spacetime that changed the length of a 4-km LIGO arm by a ten thousandth of the width of a proton, proportionally equivalent to changing the distance to the nearest star outside the Solar System by one hair's width.[33] This tiny effect from even extreme gravitational waves makes them only detectable on Earth by the most sophisticated detectors." - wiki Gravitational Wave
* Pirani wrote down an equation that made it clear that you could measure gravitational energy (p. 142 of proceedings)
	* Pirani did his undergrad at Western, no way. got the highest mark when he graduated: http://www.physics.uwo.ca/news/student_awards_archives/gold_medal_physics.html
	* died 2015

	* "Curvature of the Earth:  LIGO’s arms are so long that the curvature of the Earth is a measurable 1 meter (vertical) over the 4 km length of each arm. The most precise concrete pouring and leveling imaginable was required to counteract this curvature and ensure that LIGO’s vacuum chambers were "flat" and level. Without this work, LIGO's lasers would hit the end of each arm 1 m above the mirrors it is supposed to bounce off of!"
